Things to do before MethLab will be totally and utterly finished until
someone comes up with another idea:

Infrastructure:
 - Homepage / trac / something.

Core-stuff / dependencies:
 - Check which python version is required at least.
 - Check which PyGTK version is required at least and disable features that
   are not supported by the PyGTK version in use.

Usability:
 - Some way of telling the user a search came up empty.
 - Configurable hot-keys.
 - A proper settings dialog instead of a crappy settings menu,
   scattered context menus and the directory dialog.

Features:
 - Tag editor / tag corrector.
 - Support more audioplayers (mpd comes to mind?).
 - Tray icon and a global hotkey to bring MethLab to the foreground.
 - A menu for search result items that does useful things (search album,
   things like that).
 - Shove the DB handling into a seperate thread so the user interface won't
   ever lock up (well, unless your query yields lots of results).
