Things to do before MethLab will be totally and utterly finished until
someone comes up with another idea:

Infrastructure:
 - Homepage / trac / something

Core-stuff / dependencies:
 - Support Python 2.? - 2.4, py-sqlite2.
 - Check which PyGTK version is required and check that at runtime.
 - Look into supporting mutagen instead of TagPy.

Usability:
 - Change the expanders to .. something else (maybe buttons as suggested by
   OffHand).
 - Some way of telling the user a search came up empty.
 - Configurable hot-keys.
 - A proper settings dialog instead of a crappy menu.

Features:
 - Add search history.
 - Tag editor / tag corrector.
 - Support more audioplayers (mpd comes to mind?).
 - Custom sorting.
 - Re-ordering / enabling / disabling result columns.
 - Tray icon and a global hotkey to bring MethLab to the foreground.
 - A menu for search result items that does useful things.
 - Shove the DB handling into a seperate thread so the user interface won't
   ever lock up (well, unless your query yields lots of results).
