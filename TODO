Things to do before MethLab will be totally and utterly finished:

Core-stuff / dependencies:
 - Support Python 2.? - 2.4, py-sqlite2.
 - Check which PyGTK version is required and check that at runtime.
 - Look into supporting mutagen instead of TagPy.

Usability:
 - Change the expanders to .. something else (maybe buttons as suggested by
   OffHand).

Features:
 - Add search history.
 - Tag editor / tag corrector.
 - Support more audioplayers (mpd comes to mind?).
 - Custom sorting.
 - Re-ordering / enabling / disabling result columns.
