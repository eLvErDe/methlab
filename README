MethLab depends on the following things:
 - Python 2.5 (with the bundled sqlite3 library).
 - PyGTK 2.10 (tbh, I don't really know which version is _required_, I
   suspect PyGTK 2.6).
 - TagPy 0.91 (http://news.tiker.net/software/tagpy).

It's useful to have the following things:
 - A supported audio player (xmms, audacious, beep). Beep wasn't tested
   though.

If you want to use MethLab with XMMS, you'll also need:
 - PyXMMS (use the PyXMMS driver).
or:
 - python-ctypes (part of Python 2.5) (use the xmmsalike driver).

If you want to use MethLab with audacious or beep, you'll need:
 - python-ctypes (again, this is part of Python 2.5).
