MethLab is a music library application that can interface with various
music players (at the time of writing: xmms, beep, audacity and mpd).


The homepage of MethLab is: http://methlab.thegraveyard.org/


MethLab has the following dependencies:

 - Python 2.5 (with the bundled sqlite3 library).
   http://www.python.org/download/

 - PyGTK 2.10 (tbh, I don't really know which version is _required_, I
   suspect PyGTK 2.6). The user interface as I intended it really does
   depend on PyGTK 2.10.

 - sqlite3 and pysqlite2 or pysqlite3 (pysqlite3 is part of Python2.5.
   You'll still need the sqlite3 library though).

MethLab comes with two database sources. Each has its own dependencies:

 - Filesystem database source (for use with xmms/audacious/beep):

     You'll also need a support tagging library:
     - TagPy 0.91. Python bindings for TagLib. Fast and recommended.

     or:
     - Mutagen ?.?.? (tested version 1.10.1). Pure python so probably easy to
       install.

     It's useful to have the following things:
     - A supported audio player (xmms, audacious, beep). Beep wasn't tested
       though.

     If you want to use MethLab with XMMS, you'll also need:
     - PyXMMS (use the PyXMMS driver).
       http://people.via.ecp.fr/~flo/2002/PyXMMS/dist
     or:
     - python-ctypes (part of Python 2.5) (use the xmmsalike driver).
       http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/

     If you want to use MethLab with audacious or beep, you'll need:
     - python-ctypes (again, this is part of Python 2.5).
       http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/

 - MPD database source:

     - You'll need mpd up and running and accept passwordless connections on
       localhost:6600. If you can't make that work, you'll have to manually
       edit the pymethlab/drivers|db_sources/mpdclient3.py file (look at the
       end).
